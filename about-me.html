	My name is Angel Jauregui; a small 15 year old hispanic boy in pursuit of big dreams. I was born July 9th 2004 in Hayward California, however, I lived the first two years of my life in Teocaltiche, a small town in the east of the state of Jalisco, Mexico. For the rest of my life I've lived in Oakland, California where I attend Aspire lionel Wilson College Preparatory Academy and live with my older brother Cristian and my loving parents.

	Over the years of my life, I have developed a passion for the arts; music, drawing, painting, and film. I play the guitar and I started a collection of a certain brand of guitars, takamines. In addition, since I can remember, I've been drawing. I also like playing soccer and other sports live basketball... I'm very active.
